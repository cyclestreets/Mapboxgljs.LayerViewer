# Mapboxgljs.LayerViewer

A UI framework for showing multiple layers in Mapbox GL JS, essentially a wrapper to Mapbox GL JS which integrates various plugins into a full map UI.

Branched from the [Leaflet.LayerViewer](https://github.com/cyclestreets/Leaflet.LayerViewer/) library.

Originally written for the [CycleStreets Bikedata](https://github.com/cyclestreets/bikedata/) project.

Intended primarily as a GeoJSON viewer, but supports GeoJSON, heatmap and bitmap layers.

Layers and settings are defined using a simple, high-level, declarative structure.
